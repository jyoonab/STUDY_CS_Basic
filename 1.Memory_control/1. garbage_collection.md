# Basic Points of Garbage Collection
1. The Garbage Collection is based on 'weak generational hypothesis'
```
The 'Weak Generational Hypothesis' states that most objects survive for only a short period time.
Therefore, Garbage Collector sends long-lived objects to "old generation"
```
2. There might be little differences between each languages(in here, Java, Python, C#), \but all of them are basically use generations.

# What is Garbage Collection?
The garbage collection is a form of automatic memory management.\
Once a specific amount of memory is not used anymore, the garbage collection will free that momory to prevent the memory leaking issue.

# 3 Phases of Garbase Collection
1. Marking Phase - This phase determines which pieces memory are in use and which are not. \
- There is a reference count on every objects. \

2. Deletion Phase - Deletes Unreferenced Objects \

4. Compacting Phase - Compact the remaining objects to improve the performance \
