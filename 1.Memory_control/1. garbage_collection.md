# Basic Points of Garbage Collection
1. Garbage Collection is based on 'weak generational hypothesis'
```
The 'Weak Generational Hypothesis' states that most objects survive for only a short period time.
Therefore, Garbage Collector sends long-lived objects to "old generation"
```
2. There are little differences between each languages(in here, Java, Python, C#), \but all of them are basically use generations.
