# Basic Points of Garbage Collection
1. The Garbage Collection is based on 'weak generational hypothesis'
```
The 'Weak Generational Hypothesis' states that most objects survive for only a short period time.
Therefore, Garbage Collector sends long-lived objects to "old generation"
```
2. There might be little differences between each languages(in here, Java, Python, C#), \but all of them are basically use generations.

# What is Garbage Collection?
The garbage collection is a form of automatic memory management.\
Once a specific amount of memory is not used anymore, the garbage collection will free that momory to prevent the memory leaking issue.
