# Basic Points of Garbage Collection
1. The Garbage Collection is based on 'weak generational hypothesis'
```
The 'Weak Generational Hypothesis' states that most objects survive for only a short period time.
Therefore, Garbage Collector sends long-lived objects to "old generation"
```
2. There might be little differences between each languages(in here, Java, Python, C#), \but all of them are basically use generations.

# What is Garbage Collection?
The garbage collection is a form of automatic memory management.\
Once a specific amount of memory is not used anymore, the garbage collection will free that momory to prevent the memory leaking issue.

# 3 Phases of Garbase Collection
1. Marking Phase - This phase determines which pieces memory are in use and which are not.
- There is a reference count on every objects. \

2. Deletion Phase - Deletes Unreferenced Objects \

4. Compacting Phase - Compact the remaining objects to improve the performance \

# Overall Process of Garbage Collection(JAVA)
1. Object Allocation - new objects are allocated to the eden space
2. Filling the Eden Space - once eden space fills up, the minor garbage collection is triggered
3. Copying Referenced Objects - referenced obejcts are moved to the first survivor space(S0). Unreferenced Objects are deleted
4. Object Aging - Once first survivor space(S0) is full, objects are moving to second space(s1). Once the objects are moving, the age value is added by 1
5. Adding Aging - As the same process repeats on every minor GC, the age value from every objects is added by 1
6. Promotion - Once the age value hits the target number, the object moves to old generation
